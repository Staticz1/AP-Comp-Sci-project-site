          The first project is a drawing app My partner and I made in AP
          computer science class. The version shown is the V1 version of the
          app. In this version, you get a decent variety of options to choose
          from. You can draw (with multiple colors), erase, and create shapes
          using the buttons assigned to them! What made this app hard to make
          was trying to get all the buttons to work properly. Some of them
          wouldn’t work how my partner and I wanted them to, and sometimes, they
          stopped working entirely! This app still has a long way to go, but I
          think it’s a decent start.
